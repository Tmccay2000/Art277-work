    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <!--my paragraph begins here-->
    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b>is simply dummy text of printing and type setting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br>industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s. When an unknown printer took a gallery of type and <br>scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br>electronic typesetting, remaining esentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the released<br> of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishin software like<br><i><b><u>Aldus PageMaker</u></b></i> including version of <b><i><u>Lorem Ipsum.</u></i></b> 1914 translation by <b>H.Rackham.</b></p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sitamet, consectetur adispicing elit,sed do eiusmod tempor inciddunt ut labore<br> et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris misi<br> ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluplate velit esse<br> cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla patriatur. Excepteur sint occarcat non proident, sun in culpra<br> qui officia deserunt anim id est labourum.</p>
    
    <h1> Why do we use it</h1>
    <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readeable content of a page when looking at it's<br> layout. The point of using <b><u>Lorem Ipsum</u></b> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br> using content here, Content here", making it look like readeable English. Many desktop publishing packages and<br> web page editor now use <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> as their default model text, and a search for "lorem ipsum" will uncover<br> many web site still in their infancy. Various version have involved over the year, sometime by accident,<br> sometime on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
    <h1>Where can i get some?</h1>
    <p><b> There are many variation of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered<br> alteration in some form, by injected humour, or by <u>randomized words</u> which don't look even slightly<br> unbelievable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to bre sure there isn't anything<br> embarrasing hidden in the middle of the text.<i> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat<br> predefined chunks as neccessary, making this the first true generator on the internet. It uses a dictionary of over<br> 200 latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks<br> reasonable. The gnerated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always from repetition, injected humour, non-<br>characteristic words etc. </i></p>
